Step-by-step process of creating a website, this website. What is used, how it's used and what I have learnt.

.. PELICAN_END_SUMMARY

Since I am a web-developer, it's emberassing for me not to have a webpage, both personally and profesionally.
If I am creating websites for a living I have to contribute to internet creation as well.

Professionally it's my calling card, my notepad, scrapbook, my testing ground for new technologies as well as a place where I get and share my knowledge.

This one is my 2nd personal webpage that went live, first being an effect of my misguided youth (thank you `archive.org <https://web.archive.org/web/20100721221405/http://webdesign-log.pl/>`__), mind you I have learnt a lot creating the first one - mostly what not to do.

In the meantime (9 years...) I had made various attempts at modernizing, rewriting and rethinking my blog, around 30 that were scrapped due to being overcomplicated or underdeveloped or just impossible to create. That's how I came to realize first all-important step in creating a website.

Q & A
-----

Yup, this one is useful even for own projects, it's obvious we do it for our clients - them being a bit loose with what they want ("I want a website" is a useless ), but even for ourselves it helps clarify the requirements.

Few questions I have asked myself to understand what I really want:

**What will I use the website for? commercial venture or personal website?**

*Sharing a knowledge, personal, proving to myself I can make it work*

**What kind of content would I like to publish**

*articles and code snippets*

**Do I need a place to store data? Do I need a backend application to process your data?**

*no, I just want to write posts with minimum fuss, don't need any backend to support it if I can get away with it*

**Will I want to create a template myself or should I use some of the ready ones?**

*I am web-developer, I can create any website. On other hand I am not a designer so it will be ugly one*

**What are the most important things to me in this website?**

*Ease of use, performance, simplicity, modern technologies*

**What features would I like to have here?**

*Search if I can make it work, AMP version, tagging, comments, some social sharing, maybe few ads*

**What would I like to avoid?**

*Any kind of security issues (accounts, bots), having to manage hosting a lot, complicated release and built process*

Having answered all of those at least I could start formulating the requirements and choosing the best tools to make it happen.

That and more in the next parts.
